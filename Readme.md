# Gender Recognition

This project includes some sub-projects where several solutions for a gender classification of a voice dataset are proposed. It comes from a small project in the Speech Signal Processing class during my 6th semester in Wuhan University in Autumn 2017. Till the end of 2018, TWO solutions are realized, they are the [kmeans-KNN classification]() and the [NaiveBayesclassification](). Here is the file structure:

```
Gender Recognition
              |-- kmeans-KNN
              |-- NaiveBayes
              |-- Readme.md
```
Among the files above:
- in folder ['kmeans-KNN'](https://github.com/chentianyangWHU/Gender-Recognition/tree/master/kmeans-KNN): there is a detailed introduction for how to employee a kmeans-KNN classification for voice gender recognition;
- in folder ['NaiveBayes'](https://github.com/chentianyangWHU/Gender-Recognition/tree/master/NaiveBayes): there is a detailed introduction for how to employee a NaiveBayes classification for voice gender recognition;

Now, just have a look!
